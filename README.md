# Remainder-to-take-breaks
A simple reminder to take breaks (Coding is fun!! Sample)


A simple code to play favorite youtube videos or any urls to remind us to take periodic breaks in between work.
For the scope of this demonstration, the time period is not spread out. Instead small break times are set and the code is executed. We can set any time suitable to take breaks.
